# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

Provide the user the ability to search for a city.
Show the current and future 5 day forecast for that city.
Present the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, 
the humidity the wind speed, and the UV index (the color should indicate whether the conditions 
are favorable, moderate, or severe)
The city is added to the search history and local storage.
Clicking on a city in the search history present the current and future conditions for that city.
Search history should be saved to the browser after reloading the page and will present the last searched city forecast.
```

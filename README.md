# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story

```
Build a weather dashoard 
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
Provide the user the ability to search for a city.
Show the current and future conditions for that city.
Present the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, 
the humidity the wind speed, and the UV index (the color should indicate whether the conditions 
are favorable, moderate, or severe)
Add that city to the search history.
Show the 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, 
the temperature, and the humidity.
Clicking on a city in the search history present the current and future conditions for that city.
Save search history to local storage and when loading the page present the last searched city forecast
```
